									<h3>Fuel Cost and Consumption Manager (2016-2017)</h3>
									<p>
										<a href="https://fuel.jameld.com" target="_blank">View Webpage</a>
									</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									This project was a result of my Standard Level Computer Science class I took my junior year (2016-2017) of high school. 
									In this class, we had a project that was part of the International Baccalaureate curriculum. 
									For this project, we had to create some kind of problem for an imaginary client, and then go through the processes of creating a technical solution for that problem. 
									This was my first experiences with databases and MySQL.
								</p>
								<p>
									My imaginary client drives a 100-mile commute to and from work 6 days out of the week. 
									Since driving this long of a distance can be expensive, my client liked to keep paper logs of his distance driven, the amount of fuel, and the cost of fuel. 
									He would then take this information to calculate how fuel-efficient his car was and his average cost per mile. 
									After a couple of months, it became too cumbersome, but that information was so important to keeping him budgeted correctly. 
									The above web app was my solution to this problem.

									<h3>Custom PC Build (2015)</h3>
									<p>
										<a href="https://custompc.jameld.com" target="_blank">View Webpage</a>
									</p>									
								</header>
								<p>
									This was a project, dubbed the “personal project”, that I had during my Freshman and Sophomore years of high school. 
									For this project, we were tasked with creating a goal, planning out the criteria for said goal, and taking action to reach that goal. 
									The idea was for us to learn the processes of creation while doing something that interested us. 
									I just happened to choose to build a PC because it was what I was interested in, and I would have done it anyway.
								</p>
								<p>
									Shortly after turning in this project, I lost all my project files due to water damaging my flash drive. 
									Like any naive teenager, I hadn't backed it up to a computer or the cloud. 
									And even if it was on my computer, that would be many OS installs ago. That being said, all I have to offer about this are pictures taken in August 2019.
